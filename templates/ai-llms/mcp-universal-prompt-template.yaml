# Professional insights
mcp_optimization_notes: |
As a professional prompt engineer, MCP integration requires:

1. **Stateful Design**: Unlike stateless prompts, MCP workflows must maintain 
   context and state across tool calls

2. **Error Resilience**: MCP environments are more complex with potential 
   network, API, and tool failures requiring robust error handling

3. **Resource Awareness**: MCP tools often have rate limits, quotas, and 
   performance characteristics that must be considered

4. **Transparency**: Users need visibility into tool usage, progress, and 
   decision-making throughout the workflow

5. **Optimization**: MCP workflows should minimize redundant tool calls and 
   optimize for both speed and resource efficiency

# Template customization guide
